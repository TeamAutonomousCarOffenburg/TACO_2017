/**
 * Represents all information related to thoughts of the agent.<br>
 * While the {@link hso.autonomy.agent.model.worldmodel.IWorldModel} and {@link IAgentModel}
 * represent the measured states based on sensor information, the IThoughtModel
 * is meant to represent a higher level of information abstraction. Furthermore,
 * it is the central model to store all information that comes from inside the
 * agent and cannot be measured.<br>
 * To give a simple example: <i>IFOCalculator</i>:<br>
 * The location information for each player is a measured value and contained in
 * the {@link hso.autonomy.agent.model.worldmodel.IWorldModel}. The question which player is
 * closest to the ball can be calculated based on this information but
 * represents a thought which is not directly related to a sensor value. This
 * "thought" (which player is closest to the ball) can be integrated and
 * buffered in the IThoughtModel, which improves reusability of common
 * calculations and therefore reduces runtime.

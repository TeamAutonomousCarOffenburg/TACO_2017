/**
 * "GyroRate" sensor interface. Provides read-only access only.<br>
 * The GyroRate Sensor represents the orientation change of a body in the

 * This orientation change is represented as quaternion in a {@link Rotation}
 * object. The perceived representation is Euler-angles given in the
 * gyro-vector.

 * <strong>Note:</strong> Relative to the Robot (center of it's torso), the
 * x-axis points to the right, while the y-axis is pointing forward and the
 * z-axis go's straight up.<br>
